==============

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/Sankra/FermiContainer/blob/master/logo%402x.png" width="128" height="128">

Even simpler than the simplest IoC-container, <b>FermiContainer</b> makes IoC easy for everyone. 

It supports registration of interfaces and implementing classes, and through constructor injection the dependencies known to the container are automatically resolved. No attributes or XML configuration are needed. This is simplicity at its best and FermiContainer is truly a C# IoC container for the rest of us.
